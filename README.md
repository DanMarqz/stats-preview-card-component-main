## My process

First I started with giving classes to the components in HTML so I could format them with each class. Then I started to layout with CSS starting with the color formatting, font family and then start with the sizes of the text and image cards. After that I started with the layout of the responsive view (375 px).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I would like to learn more about CSS for website development.

I would like to learn in a more practical way what it is: 
- Flexbox
- Grid
- CSS Preprocessor

I still don't know everything about CSS.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](http://w3schools.com/) - Everything I used in this project I learned and searched from the CSS section of w3schools.
